Package Link : https://lnkd.in/gaApaPz5

## How to implement :

1. Go their official site and create a account : https://lottiefiles.com/
2. Products >> Free Animation > And download any animation u want or copy the URL (U need to download it in your site local directory first )
3. Add the package and import the package in your flutter file 
4. There are various ways to import the particular file in your app . But i have shown two ways to import it . 
* Lottie.asset()
U can download the particular json file in your device , put it in your assets folder in flutter project (update the your pubspec.yaml file) and rest is similar how you import a particular image in your app . 
* Lottie.network()
Or you can use the more simple way . U can directly upload the file from the site in your app , but for this the app should have a active network connection.
